# Grant Robinson's Web Portfolio
This project is a portfolio that provides an overview of my experience as a Software Engineer.

their appropriate sections.

## Challenge Faced

One challenge that I faced with this project was getting the text to mesh well with other elements (e.g. buttons). This problem is highlighted on desktop when adjusting the height and width of the websiteâ€™s view. The same proportion problem can be seen on mobile (mainly a phone), especially when viewing the About Me screen. A resolution I found was using percentages for the height and width of elements in CSS. However, this issue still persists, so I will work to fix this problem as time goes on.

## Issues

<b> 1. Dimensions/proportions: </b> On a webpage, the buttons and text may overlap with each other as well as the images based on the height/width of the webpage at the time of use. Zooming in and out of the page, and adjusting the height and width of the window can cause this issue. For the best viewing experience, my recommendation is to use the default view when loading up this website.
